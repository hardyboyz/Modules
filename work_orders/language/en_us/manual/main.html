<h1>Work Order Module</h1>

<p>The work order module is intended to help control the manufacturing
process when assembling inventory. Features include:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Task driven work flow process</li>
  <li>Sign-off ability for production workers and quality control</li>
  <li>Task time tracking for job estimation</li>
  <li>Revision control for process management</li>
  <li>Ability to assemble into inventory (create a journal entry
similar to Inventory -&gt; Assemblies)</li>
  <li>Uses Quantity of Allocation in inventory to identify lack of
availability of assembly parts</li>
  <li>Work Order form lists tasks, sign off requirements, required
parts and sign off blocks.</li>
</ul>

<p>How
does it work? Work Orders are broken into a series of tasks. The
tasks are combined to create a work order template for a given sku.
The work order template is then executed with statistics, data and
sign-offs recorded in a work order journal (not associated with the
main journal of PhreeBooks)</p>

<h2>Work Order Tasks - Overview</h2>

<p>When building a product, the assembly process can be broken into a
series
of tasks. These tasks make up the building blocks of the work order.
Click here for more detailed information regarding work order tasks.</p>

<h2>Work Order Builder - Overview</h2>

<p>Once the tasks for building an inventory item, the work order
builder
sequences the tasks required for assembling a specific product. The
Work Order Builder only allows one sku for each template. Click here
for more details on building a work order template. Once a work order
template has been executed, it must be revised if the process is
changed. This is for quality control.</p>

<h2>Work Order Manager - Overview</h2>

<p>The work order manager is the execution of a work order template.
The
work order manager tracks the assembly of an inventory item,
allocates material and assembles item in the inventory database.

<h2>An Example</h2>

<p>We
want to assemble a bicycle (must be in inventory as an assembly
already). The steps required (very simply example) are:</p>

<ol>

  <li>Pull parts from stock room.</li>
  <li>Assemble bicycle per assembly procedure.</li>
  <li>Inspect finished product.</li>
  <li>Record number of bicycles into inventory database. </li>
</ol>

<h4>Step 1: We need to create the tasks using the Work Order Task
builder</h4>

<ol>

  <li>Click on Inventory -&gt; Work Order Tasks.</li>
  <li>Enter information
on the form Task Name : Pull Parts
Description : Pull parts as listed on the work
order form Department : Manufacturing
(Set up in Company -&gt; Module Administration -&gt; Contacts -&gt;
Properties -&gt; Maintain Departments tab<br>
Ref Documents &amp; Ref Drawings : leave blank<br>
Task Time : 0.5 Hours<br>
Mfg Sign-off, QA Sign-off, Data Entry &amp;
ERP Entry : No </li>
  <li>Press the Save icon to save the task</li>
</ol>

<p>Repeat the above procedure for the remaining 3 steps with the
following
differences:</p>

<p>Step 2. Change the task name and description, MFG Sign-off to Yes,
Data Entry to Yes (for serial numbers)</p>

<p>Step 3: Change the task name and description. QA Sign-off to Yes.</p>

<p>Step 4: Change the task name and description. ERP Entry to Yes.</p>

<h4>Step 2: We need to build a template.</h4>

<ol>

  <li>Click on Inventory -&gt; Work Order Builder</li>
  <li>Click the New icon</li>
  <li>Enter the information on the form as follows: Title : Build
Bicycle SKU : Select
a SKU from the search pop-up icon. (the bicycle
assembly needs to be in the Inventory database already), description is
automatically filled in Use Allocation : Yes Ref Documents &amp; Ref
Drawings : blank </li>
  <li>On the first task line, click on the search icon and select Pull
Parts from the pop-up.</li>
  <li>Click on the Add a line icon and repeat step 4 for the remaining
three tasks.</li>
  <li>Click on the Save icon to save the work order template.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Step 3: We need to generate a work order to let manufacturing know
to build a bicycle.</h4>

<ol>

  <li>Click on Inventory -&gt; Work Order Manager</li>
  <li>Click the New icon</li>
  <li>Click the search icon next to the SKU field and select the Build
Bicycle work order. The
title and SKU are filled into the form along with the task list.</li>
  <li>Enter the number of bicycles to build, we’ll build 2 for now.</li>
  <li>Enter any comments, special instructions, etc. onto the Notes
field.</li>
  <li>Click on the Print icon to save the work order and print the Work
Order form.
The screen will return to the Work Order Manager and should display our
work order with open status. This will allocate the parts required to
assemble the bicycle and verify stock is available.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Step 4: Let’s build a bicycle</h4>

<ol>

  <li>Select the work order from the Work Order Manager screen. this
will open the build page highlighting the step in process.</li>
  <li>When step 1 has been completed, click on the Update button on the
right of the screen. Step 1 will be posted and step two will be
highlighted.</li>
  <li>When step 2 has been completed, enter the assemblers user name
and password and press the update button. remember in task Assemble
bicycle, we required
manufacturing sign-off to track who assembled the bicycle.</li>
  <li>When step 3 has been completed, enter QA’s user name and password
and press the Update button. This will post step 3 and highlight step 4.</li>
  <li>Press update on step 4 to complete the work order, close it out,
assemble 2 bicycles in inventory (assuming parts are available) and
un-allocate the parts (as they have
been used to build the bicycle).</li>
</ol>
