<h1>Work Order Builder</h1>

<p>The Work Order Builder provides the ability to build templates from
which items can be assembled. A work
order template consists of one or more work order tasks in sequence to
help control the assembly process as an integral part of a quality
control system.</p>

<h2>Adding a Work Order Template</h2>

<p>Work order templates are managed through the work order Builder
screen. To add a template, follow the steps below:</p>

<ol start="1">

main screen currently being viewed, click the New
icon <img style="width: 32px; height: 32px;" alt="New" src="../../../../../themes/default/icons/32x32/actions/document-new.png">.</li>
  <li class="c0">Fill in the fields as defined:<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Work Order Title</span>: Contains
a short title to use for the template. This title is used when
generating work orders from the pop-up list.<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">SKU</span>: Enter a sku or select
a sku from the Search pop-up list.

parts required to build the assembly.<br>

provide additional direction/clarification/process control while
assembling the sku.<br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Ref Drawings</span>: Lists any

direction/clarification/process control while assembling the sku.</li>
  <li class="c0">For all the task steps needed populate the procedure
list to assemble the sku by selecting from the
list of tasks created with the Work Order Task process. The sequence
should be the same as what it would take to build the item.</li>
